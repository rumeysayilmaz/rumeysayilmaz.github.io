I am a design engineer with a bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and a masters degree in Nanoscience and Nanoengineering. Thanks to my adventurous parents, I have traveled across the oceans and seas and grew up in a number of different countries in various continents. I love sharing my experiences and thoughts and am passionate about realizing DIY projects in almost all interesting disciplines including engineering, health, lifestyle, crafting, crocheting, beading and so on.
